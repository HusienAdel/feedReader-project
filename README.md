# Project Overview:

I have a feedreader App get feeds from sites rss and I will fetch them as given code , my role here to check the app with Jasmine unit testing for every step(spec)and expect the result and check it with Jasmine matcher as boolean.



## What  I Do ?

Using Jasime for JavaScript Unit testing for small app like feedReader and divid my app to (spec) to check and expect the results and check it .



## How to Run application and check the result of Unit testing:
Download the app from github and extract it then view the index.html in your browser and With jasmine you will get all the result in down section of Page as green that means that every thing is Ok ;)


## the feedreader checklist test:

* test for all feeds has already define and not empty
* test feeds to have url and check it not to be empty
* test feeds to have a name and check it to not to be empty (name)
* check the menu hidden =true in our page dom tree and it means that our sidemenu is still hidden
* check if menu link click wil appear the sidemenu & If  clicked again the sidemenu will disappear (toggle click)
* test the load function works and get data (entry) in feed container
* test first & second feed entries in feedlist and compare them if not same that mean we get a diff entries so load works fine and our feedreader works prefct ;)
